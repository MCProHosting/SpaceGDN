    "description": "All the mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play. It has all the basics that most ftb packs include but with a nice mix of some of the newer mods and also a few mods that make the game more interesting and harder such as Spice of Life, Bloodmoons, Infernal Mobs and Roguelike Dungeons.  The pack is constantly being updated and has a somewhat active curse chat if you want to find out more.",
